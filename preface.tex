There has been made noticeable progress in natural language processing since the first deep neural networks attempts. With multiple new approaches and \todo{not a sentence} inventions such as multitask learning, word embeddings, RNN, attention and the transformer architecture.   Last year \cite{devlin2018bert} created BERT and managed to achieve state-of-the-art performance in eleven natural language processing tasks, including GLUE (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy (4.6\% absolute improvement) and SQuAD problems.


In this thesis, we will try to use those novel approaches to predict relation between two entities based on a Czech sentence. First part of this thesis will be focused on data. We will  introduce some existing English datasets for Entity Relation Extraction. Than we will describe how we prepared data for Czech version of this task using distant supervision on Czech Wikipedia and Wikidata. Second part \todo{o čem bude druhá část}
