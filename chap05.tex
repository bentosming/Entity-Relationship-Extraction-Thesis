\chapter{Relationship Extraction on CERED}
The goal of this part of our thesis is to train a relationship extraction model for the Czech language. To the best of our knowledge, there is no baseline for such model, since there is no Czech relationship extraction datasets. In the first part of this thesis, we generated CEREDs, a family of relationship extraction models, that we can use.

If we just trained the model on our dataset, we would be unable to determine, if the model is well designed. We therefore adapt the model to be trainable both on Czech and on English. We assume that if the English version is competitive on popular English relationship extraction dataset, the Czech version is reasonably good.

In this chapter, we first describe the model, then we evaluate it on English datasets and lastly we report the results on CEREDs.
