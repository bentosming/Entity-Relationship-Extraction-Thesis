\section{TACRED dataset}
The TAC Relation Extraction Dataset was introduced in \cite{zhang2017tacred}. Authors claim \begin{quote}
 training data has often been
too noisy for reliable training of relation extraction systems
\end{quote}

\begin{quotation}
... machine learning approaches have suffered from two key problems: (1) the models used have been insufficiently tailored to relation extraction, and (2) there has been insufficient annotated data available to satisfy the training of data-hungry models, such as deep learning models.
\end{quotation}
